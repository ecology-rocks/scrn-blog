Feral cats are typically unapproachable by people. They can admittedly be a nuisance in certain areas. Some people advocate for relocation as the best way to deal with these animals, but is it really the best option? There are pros and cons to relocating feral cats, and it's important to consider all of them before making a decision.

As the Street Cat Rescue Network, we work with well-meaning citizens all the time who may believe that relocating cats is the best solution. However, a feral cat colony forms in a particular location for a reason. A colony of feral cats may form because it is a dumping ground, because there is a food source, or because there is good shelter for adult cats.

Successful relocation of an entire colony is a challenging endeavor. In this blog article, we'll discuss what a successful and safe relocation looks like, and some great alternatives to moving community cats to a new location. Let's get started!

## What is a feral cat?

A feral cat is a domestic cat that has been abandoned or has reverted to a wild state via multiple generations of stray cats. Feral cats are typically wary of humans and are not suited to living indoors. A truly feral cat does not approach humans, allow petting or handling, and usually does not like other creatures - like dogs - either. It is a wild animal in a cuddly, domesticated form.

There are a lot of community cats and outdoor cats that are not truly feral. These cats may allow some human touch, may come close for food or handling, and can form strong bonds with humans eventually. These cats may represent cat escapes or abandoned animals. They eventually settle into a new location with a colony of feral cats.

This hybrid-feral/outdoor cat can make excellent pets for people who are willing to put in the time and effort to socialize them. But with an abundance of cats already in shelters that are perfectly domesticated, all the cats outside are poor targets for adoption efforts. Usually, a former street cat becomes an indoor cat after a caring human intervenes during a health crisis or other situation.

## Why do some feel that relocation of feral cats is necessary?

Unfortunately, feral cats often pose a threat to native wildlife. They can prey on small animals, and their territorial nature can disrupt the delicate balance of an ecosystem. In addition, feral cats can carry diseases that can be deadly to native wildlife.

These are rarely the reasons that people look for a new location for outdoor cats. Instead, it is usually a human-comfort thing: people complain about cat poop in their flowers, or new development is going to destroy the colony home.

Relocated cats have a higher risk of things like car-hits, death, illness, and loss of a food source. While cats adjust eventually, there is a time period where cats lives are at risk when relocation is happening. So if you must relocate a colony, be sure to be well prepared to do so.

## How do you determine if a cat is feral or not?

One of the first things to consider when trying to determine if a cat is feral is its appearance. Feral cats are typically thin and have mangy-looking fur. They may also have scars or other injuries from fighting with other animals. In contrast, pet cats are usually well-groomed and well-fed. Another clue is behavior. Feral cats are often afraid of humans and will run away or hide when approached.

They may also hiss, growl, or strike when cornered. Pet cats, on the other hand, are typically friendly and curious around people. Finally, you can often tell if a cat is feral by its habitat. Feral cats typically live in colonies near sources of food, such as garbage dumps or restaurants. They often make their homes in abandoned buildings or cars.

## What are the steps involved in relocating a feral cat to a new home?

If you must relocate a cat colony or an individual feral cat, here are some relocation tips. First, it takes three to four weeks at a new location for a cat to understand that the location is permanent. If you are moving a colony or single cat, you must have a safe, contained space, like pre-installed large cages, for them to occupy during the relocation. If a cat escapes before the acclimation period, it is likely that they will try to return to their old location, which may be miles away.

Second, you'll need to provide a permanent outdoor shelter, like a like a shed or similar structure. Horse stables or a barn may also work. After the acclimation period, you should provide food and water in this new location. Cats who are fed dry food or other food sources will tend to remain in a location. The property owners or caretakers must continue to provide food in the new environment long after the confinement period is over.

Finally, keep an eye out in the colony members for any new cats. Cats do naturally travel or get dumped. If you find other cats, you'll need to make sure that they are spayed and neutered. A feeding station will attract pregnant cats, and you don't want the colony to grow.

## How can people help support feral cat efforts in their community?

Feral cats are a familiar sight in many neighborhoods, but they are often misunderstood. These cats are not the same as strays, which are socialized to humans and can be adopted into homes. Feral cats, on the other hand, are wild animals that are fearful of people. As a result, they are not suitable candidates for adoption and must be relocated to a safe location.

There are a number of ways that people can help support feral cat efforts in their community. One is by donating to a local organization that specializes in this work. These organizations provide trap-neuter-return (TNR) services, which involve humanely trapping feral cats, spaying or neutering them, and then returning them to their original location. This helps to reduce the overall population of feral cats and also makes it easier to care for the remaining cats.

Another way to help is by volunteering to assist with TNR efforts. This can involve everything from setting up traps to transporting cats to and from the veterinarian. By working together, we can help make our communities more welcoming for all furry friends.

Finally, you can donate to efforts like this one. The Street Cat Rescue Network exists to connect people and resources across the United States. We provide assistance and advice to those who are relocating feral cats or doing other important work in the community.

Feral cats are often misunderstood and maligned, but they can be successfully managed with the help of compassionate people in their community.
