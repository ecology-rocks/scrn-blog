When the weather starts to get cold, most people bundle up in jackets, hats, and scarves to stay warm. But what about stray cats? How do stray cats survive cold weather? Stray cats have some tricks up their sleeves that help them stay warm during winter. In this blog post, we will discuss how stray cats and feral cats survive in the cold weather.


## 1. Outdoor cats have a thick layer of fur that helps keep them warm in cold weather

When the temperature drops, outdoor cats have one major advantage over humans: a thick coat of fur. These coats not only provide warmth for the kitties, but also work as natural waterproofing during rain and snow. And did you know that this fur can even trap air to act as additional insulation?

Just think about how cozy and comfortable a cat looks when they're all fluffed up - that's Mother Nature's way of making sure they stay warm in the cold months. So next time you see a furry feline curled up outside, take comfort in knowing that they have special equipment to handle whatever winter weather comes their way.

That being said, when it gets severely cold, your local neighborhood cats may need help staying warm. Many stray or feral cats benefit from an outdoor cat shelter, which can be built for less than $20 or purchased at most pet stores.

## 2. Feral cats can curl up into a tight ball to conserve heat

Did you know that outdoor cats have a special ability to keep warm in cold weather? When temperatures drop, they are able to curl up into tight balls, tucking their heads and paws under their bodies to conserve heat. This ingenious adaptation helps them survive and thrive in the wild - especially during the chilly winter months.

And remember, if you want to protect feral cats from the elements year-round, consider bringing them indoors or building a cozy shelter for colder seasons. Providing an outdoor cat shelter with a feeding station is a good way to make sure that they can maintain their body heat and stay safe during the winter. Everybody deserves to stay warm and cozy during the chilly winter months!

## 3. Their ears and tails help them regulate their body temperature

Did you know that our feline friends have some pretty cool adaptations to help them stay comfortable? One of these is their flexible and mobile ears, which not only allow them to hear a mouse scurrying under the snow, but also helps regulate their body temperature.

When it's hot out, cats can position their ears in different directions to maximize airflow. And during colder weather, they can turn their ears back to increase insulation. Their tail also plays a role in regulating temperature - by wrapping it around themselves or tucking it close to their body, cats can conserve heat and keep warm.

So next time you spot an outdoor cat lounging in the sun or snuggling up for a nap, remember how their cute ears and tails serve dual purposes as both sensory organs and temperature regulators!

## 4. Feral cats may seek out warm places, like cars or sheds, to sleep in

Did you know that outdoor cats may be seeking shelter in your car or shed? These feline friends are always on the hunt for a cozy spot to take a nap, and in the cold winter months they'll often snuggle up under the hood of a car or sneak into an unlocked shed.

While this might seem like a harmless behavior, it can actually pose some serious risks to both your cat and your property. In addition to potential injuries from moving engine parts, carbon monoxide leaking from the car can be deadly for cats.

It's also important to make sure your cat hasn't made a nest near flammable materials such as lawnmowers or gas cans in your shed. So before starting your car or locking up your shed, take a moment to check for sleeping cats and provide them with a warm and safe alternative shelter.

If you provide adequate shelter through a cat shelter with food and water, your local feral cat is less likely to find himself inside your car engine. Plus, providing permanent shelter for the cat lets it thrive, even if you never touch or love on it. Provide some canned food and dry food even in cold weather - your furry friend will thank you!

## 5. Feral cats get help from humans like you!

Winter can be harsh on outdoor cats, with frigid temperatures and scarce food sources. Fortunately, there are simple ways you can help these kitties make it through the cold season. Providing a warm shelter for outdoor cats to snuggle up in is one way to ensure their survival.

Setting out extra wet food and water will also assist with their survival, as frozen water can make it difficult for feral and stray cats to hydrate properly. If you live really far north, you can buy a heated water dish to keep your outdoor cats food in. If you can't afford that, you can just change the wet food and water frequently to help the cats get access to food and water.

And finally, keeping an eye on any heavy snowfall or unfavorable weather conditions can allow you to take proactive measures before it becomes a problem for these fur babies. Even if you don't normally, you can leave your garage or shed door open a crack when it's supposed to get super cold to provide temporary shelter.

Even if the space isn't as warm as inside your house, it'll be better than sleeping in the bushed. By taking part in these small but important actions, you can make a big difference in an outdoor cat's life during the winter season. So don't hesitate - start helping today!

## Final thoughts about community cats when it gets cold

As we enter the colder months and Thanksgiving approaches, it's important to remember our community cats may not have a warm home to retreat to. Strays often struggle to survive outside during the winter. While feeding community cats is a kind gesture, the best solution is to try and get them spayed or neutered and find them a loving forever home. Donating to a Stray Cat Fund (like ours) is a great way to make sure that kitties in your area receive the care that they need.

Animal shelters often offer reduced adoption fees for cats during the winter in an effort to keep them off the streets. If you come across a stray cat during this time, consider reaching out to your local shelter to see what options are available. All stray or feral cats deserve a chance at warmth and comfort, especially during this chilly season. Let's do our part in making sure they have a place they can call their own.
