There are millions of feral cats living in the United States, and while Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is the most humane way to manage these populations, it's often met with resistance from people who believe that feral cats should be eradicated.

TNR is the process of trapping feral cats, having them neutered and vaccinated, and then returning them to their colonies so they can live out their lives there. It's a proven method for managing feral cat populations that also reduces the number of unwanted kittens born each year. TNR cats live healthy lives and defend their territory from other free roaming cats. It's a win-win for everyone.

## What is TNR and why is it important for feral cats

Have you ever seen a feral cat before? These are the cats that you see living outside, often looking scruffy and afraid. They are not pets, but they are still living creatures that deserve our care and compassion. That's where TNR comes in. TNR stands for Trap-Neuter-Return, and it is a method of population control for feral cats. Let's take a closer look at why TNR is so important.

Feral cats are un-socialized to people, which means that they are not good candidates for adoption into homes. While sometimes community cats can be brought inside, it takes time and patience. They are also not candidates for traditional shelters, as they will be euthanized because they cannot be adopted out. This leaves them out on the streets to fend for themselves. However, there are kind-hearted people who want to help these animals, which is where TNR comes in.

TNR involves trapping the stray cats, taking them to be spayed or neutered, and then returning them to their original location. This helps to control the population of feral cats, as well as making their lives better. Spaying or neutering the cat helps to reduce their stress levels overall, and it also reduces their chances of getting diseases.

TNR is a long-term solution that requires dedication and commitment from everyone involved. You can TNR both female cats and male cats, but it is perhaps most important to get the female cats, because they can make community cat populations explode.

Stray cats are all around us, but we often don't think about them until we see one running across the street or digging through garbage cans. They are living creatures that need our help. That's where TNR comes in.

## How to trap a feral cat

So, you've decided you want to trap a feral cat. Maybe you've seen one too many cats scratching up your garden, or maybe you're just an animal lover who wants to give a home to a homeless kitty. Whatever your reasons, trapping community cats is not as difficult as it may seem. Here's everything you need to know to get started.

The first step in trapping a stray cat is to gather the supplies you'll need. You'll need a live trap, bait, and a towel to use over top of the cage. You can purchase a live trap at your local hardware store or online; just make sure the trap is big enough to comfortably hold an adult cat. As for bait, wet cat food usually does the trick.

Once you have your supplies, it's time to set the trap. If you're using a cage-type trap, place it in an area where the cat is known to frequent and cover it with a towel or blanket so the cat feels comfortable going inside. If you're using a box trap, place it on its side with the door open and propped up with something heavy (like a rock) so it doesn't close prematurely. Here again, placing the trap in an area where the cat is known to frequent will increase your chances of success.

Once the trap is set, all you have to do is wait for the kitty to take the bait. It's important to check the trap regularly (every few hours), as cats are not always caught on the first try. When you do catch a cat, be sure that you have somewhere safe to store it between when you're getting it neutered and when you're releasing it. You cannot leave a cat in a trap outside unattended for very long.

## Transporting your TNR

So, you've trapped a cat as part of a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program. What happens next? First, you'll need to take the cat to its TNR appointment where it will be examined and neutered. They will often be ear-tipped, which involves removing a small portion of their ear while they're under anesthesia to identify them as a sterilized outdoor cat.

After this procedure, the cat is typically returned to their original location within 24 hours. However, TNR doesn't end there. It is best to continue to care for the stray cats in your neighborhood, because they will defend their territory from free roaming cats.

The folks caring for the community cats will continue to provide food and shelter for them, monitor their health, and address any issues that arise. Over time, the TNR program should result in a lower feral cat population in the area and a healthier population overall. So while it may take some time and effort, TNR can have long-lasting positive effects on both cats and the community.

## The benefits of TNR

TNR has a number of benefits. For one, it reduces the number of unwanted animals who are euthanized each year in shelters. In addition, it helps control the spread of disease among feral cat colonies, and it cuts down on the noise and nuisance complaints often associated with a feral cat colony.

Moreover, TNR is cost-effective; Trap-Neuter-Return saves taxpayers' money by reducing the number of cats entering the shelter system. Finally, TNR improves the lives of the feral cats who are returned to their colonies; they no longer have to worry about reproducing, and they can live out their lives without fear of being trapped and removed from their homes. Managing community cat colonies doesn't have to be difficult.

If you're thinking about getting involved in TNR, there are a few things you should know. First, you'll need to trap the cats using live traps (the kind that don't harm the animal). Second, you'll need to take them to a participating vet or clinic to be spayed or neutered; many clinics offer low-cost or even free services for feral cats. Be sure you know where you're taking the cat before you trap it.

TNR programs do require that the cat goes back. You'll need to return the cats to their original location; this is important because it's where they feel most comfortable and have established themselves as part of a colony. These defined neighborhood cats will defend territory from other free roaming cats.

## How you can help support TNR in your community

Every year, millions of cats are born in the United States. Unfortunately, many of these cats are abandoned or left to fend for themselves. As a result, there are hundreds of thousands of feral (wild) cats living on the streets. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is the only humane and effective way to reduce the number of feral cats.

If you care about animals and want to make a difference in your community, here are some ways you can help support TNR:

### 1. Donate to or fundraise for a local TNR organization.

There are likely several TNR organizations in your area. These organizations rely on donations to help cover the costs of spaying or neutering feral cats. You can donate money directly to an organization or hold a fundraiser. For example, you could have a bake sale or car wash and donate the proceeds to a local TNR group.

### 2. Volunteer your time.

Many TNR organizations could use an extra set of hands. Volunteer opportunities include trapping feral cats, transporting them to the vet, foster kittens until they are old enough to be spayed or neutered, or socializing feral kittens so they can be adopted into homes.

### 3. Educate others about TNR.

When talking to friends, family, and co-workers about TNR, it is important to use respectful language. Remember that these people may not be familiar with the concept of TNR and may need some time to adjust to the idea. Be patient and be willing to answer any questions they may have about the process.

### 4. Spay or neuter your own pet cats!

One of the best ways to reduce the number of homeless cats is to make sure that your own pets are spayed or neutered—and encourage others to do the same! Not only will this prevent unwanted litters of kittens, but it will also help your cat live a longer, healthier life since they will no longer be reproducing.

### 5. Be a responsible pet parent from day one.

If you are thinking about adding a cat to your family, please do your research first! There are many resources available online that can help you decide if cat ownership is right for you and your lifestyle—and what kind of cat would be the best fit for you and your family dynamic. Once you have decided that you are ready for a cat, please consider adopting from a shelter or rescue group instead of buying from a breeder; there are millions of amazing adoptable cats out there who need loving homes!

### 6. Support businesses that promote Trap-Neuter-Return

patronize businesses that support Trap-Neuter-Return efforts in your community—or start one yourself! If you own a business, consider donating a percentage of profits to a local TNR organization; if you work at a business, ask management if they would be interested in starting such a program.

## Conclusion

Together we can make a difference for feral cats in our communities by supporting Trap-Neuter-Return programs—whether through donations, volunteering our time, educating others about responsible pet ownership, or simply being kind and respectful when talking about this sensitive issue.
