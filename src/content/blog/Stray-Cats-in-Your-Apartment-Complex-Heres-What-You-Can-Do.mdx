title: Stray Cats in Your Apartment Complex? Hereâ€™s What You Can Do
---

Do you have a stray cats in apartment complex type of problem? Are there cats roaming the halls and lurking around the dumpsters? If so, you're not alone. Stray and feral cats are becoming an increasingly common issue in apartment complexes across the country.

While these creatures can be cute, they can also be a nuisance. In this blog post, we'll provide some tips on how to deal with stray cats in your complex in a humane way.

Solving a problem with feral cats comes down to three main steps:

* Fixing any structural problems, like out of control trash and empty food containers, dumpsters located in an easy-to-access location, or having unspayed/neutered cats on the property
* Working with a local animal shelter or humane society to do the appropriate thing and spay/neuter any animal residents
* Providing care for the sterile cats to prevent more cats from joining the colony
* Monitor for any new cats or kittens and provide care if necessary

## Talk to your apartment complex manager about the situation and see if they have any solutions or ideas

Often, concerned tenants feel that animal control needs to step in when multiple stray animals are present. While an apartment manager may be well versed in dealing with feral cats, they may also not know what they can legally do in the apartment building to solve the problem.

Property owners may end up taking a more violent approach to the poor cats than someone working for a Humane Society. So you may want to approach the local Humane Society or rescue group first, and see if you can facilitate the appropriate thing.

While property owners may see feral cats as a health and hazard issue, cats are not generally the cause of disease or accidents in apartment complexes. If there's a feral cat "problem", there's likely another underlying problem, like dumpsters located in an opportune location. This is where you should focus your attention with an apartment manager or property owners.

## Contact a local animal shelter to see if they can help with trapping and spaying/neutering the cats

Animal overpopulation is a major issue, and spaying/neutering pets is one of the best ways to combat it. If you are struggling with any kind of feral cat problem in your yard or neighborhood, contacting a local animal shelter to see if they can help with trapping and spaying/neutering the cats is a great option.

Not only does this prevent more kittens from entering an already-oversaturated animal population, but it also serves to make sure that the cats living in your area are healthy and have had the necessary medical attention. Spaying/neutering can be very expensive for individuals, so teaming up with a local shelter that offers these services can be tremendously helpful in tackling your neighborhood's feral cat population problem.

## Set up appropriate care for the remaining cats

Taking care of our furry feline friends can be an important step to making sure they stay healthy and safe. Setting up food and water stations around your complex is an easy way to help out the cats in your area without having to make a grand gesture.

Having these accessible spots available will not only provide nourishment, it will also keep cats close by. That means that they won't be in the parking lot, getting run over on nearby roads, or getting eaten by the local dog.

### Set up feral cat shelters for cats to sleep in when it gets cold

Providing shelter for feral cats is an important and kind way to help our outdoor feline friends stay safe from the cold. Feral cat shelters provide a warm home away from home - whether it's in a special cat house or even a homemade DIY cardboard box lined with cozy blankets.

Not only are these shelters helpful for keeping cats safe from harsh weather conditions, but they also provide a much-needed sense of comfort and security for cats that have been abandoned or have never known family. By providing them warmth, we can improve their quality of life and maybe even show them some kindness that has been denied too many times before.

There are lots of great resources for building shelters. Property owners may even make it a community event to prep shelters for the stray cat situation. Extra shelters could go to a local rescue group.

## Keep an eye out for any feral kittens that may need extra care and attention

Feral kittens can be found all over the world, from urban centers to remote countryside locations. It is important to keep an eye out for these vulnerable animals, as they may need extra care and attention in order to survive. Be mindful of their hiding places, such as long grasses, tall weeds and even under cars or buildings.

If you find any feral kittens in your area, it may be a great idea to consult a local veterinarian on how to best provide them with the necessary care that they need. Remember - these wild cats deserve our help, so don't be afraid to step in if they require a little extra love and support!

## Final thoughts

Having an apartment complex full of cats may seem like an impossible situation, but with a little effort it is possible to make the lives of both you and the cats better. Be aware that the "old school" solution - euthanizing the cats - does not get at the root of the problem. Additional strays will return because there is a food source to feed feral cats, tenants are leaving food around, or there is some other draw for the animals.

It may be that concerned tenants feel comfortable when they know that the stray cats are being taken care of in the apartment complex. A humane solution of trap-neuter-return is win-win for al; neighbors and cats involved.
